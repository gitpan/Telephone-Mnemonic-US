Telephone-Mnemonic-US version 0.01
===============================

Telephone::Mnemonic::US - Maps US telephone numbers from mnemonic 'easy-to-remember' words to digits, it
can also attempts the reverse and maps telephone digits to mnemonic words.

 to_words('(263) 748 7233');           => ameritrade  
 to_words('(263) 748 7233', 9);        => ameritrade   but might timeout after 9 sec of searching
 to_num('ameritrade') ;                => (263) 748 7233 


The scripts tel2num.pl and tel2mnemonic.pl are usufull for instant gratification.

NOTE: Only for the case of converting to mnemonics, I assume your system already has a dictionary
in either /usr/dict/words or /usr/share/dict/words sorted in dictionary order. It should be a
problem for nost Unix system. I'll warn you during installation if I can't find.
